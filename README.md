## Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the zip file)**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mersal-shipping-calculator.git
    cd mersal-shipping-calculator
    ```

2.  **Install a local web server (optional but recommended)**:
    If you have Node.js installed, you can use `live-server` for convenience:
    ```bash
    npm install -g live-server
    ```

3.  **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    live-server
    ```
    This will open the `index.html` file in your default browser, and the application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or a similar address).

    Alternatively, you can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
